# Heritage Tree
 
this is a project - on course - to manage all the tree heritage of a person.
where you will can:
  - manage a new person
  - manage the relationship with others persons
  - manage the important events of that person
  - manage photos individual and groupal ( probably with IA face recognition???)
  - manage texts, tagging people on your tree
  - manage the location of the person as place of birth and death

The plan is to create the back-end first using .Net 6 and SQL-Server, and then start with front end using Angular +13

back-end:
		1- basic API comunication to do all the tasks
		2- Exception management
  3- add user management 
  4- add security

Front-end
  1- start with the basics forms to upload and data edition
  2- add a visualization tree or similar model to get all the data in an easy view

far future:
  1- find missing relationships
