# Heritage Tree
 
this is a project - on course - to manage all the tree heritage of a person.
where you will can:
  - manage a new person
  - manage the relationship with others persons
  - manage the important events of that person
  - manage photos individual and groupal ( probably with IA face recognition???)
  - manage texts, tagging people on your tree
  - manage the location of the person as place of birth and death

The plan is to create the back-end first using .Net 6 and SQL-Server, and then start with front end using Angular +13
